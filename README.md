This project was developed using Flora wearable electronics platform from Adafruit (http://www.adafruit.com/products/659) and the super tiny accelerometer/magnetometer sensor based on the LM303 (http://www.adafruit.com/products/1247). They power NeoPixel strips (http://www.adafruit.com/products/1426) mounted on the underside of roller skates.

You'll need some Arduino libraries to get started, and I'd recommend the Adafruit Arduino IDE so that it will work with the Flora/Gemma right away.

Check this out for links to the Adafruit Arduino IDE and other getting started stuff: http://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-flora/download-software

LM303 Library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LSM303DLHC
NeoPixel Library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel
Universal Sensor Library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor

All this stuff is brand new to me and I'm just playing around with it. Right now we can change the color of the NeoPixel strips based on compass heading. In the future I'll be adding other modes. Color splash on foot fall, brightness changes based on speed, etc.

I really appreciate all the cool project made by Becky Stern lately. Super inspirational.
